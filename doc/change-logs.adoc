** `set-debug-level!` added.
** `set-line-bullet!` added.

* v0.7.8
** `set-cljs-devtools!` added.

* v0.7.6
** Bumps `binaryage/devtools 1.0.2`
**  Version matching with the fixed version of `philoskim/debux-stubs 0.7.6`

** The `:msg` (or `:m`) option added for dynamic message creation.

* v0.7.0
** Tagged literals (`#d/dbg`, `#d/dbgn`, `#d/clog`, `#d/clogn`) added. So in _no options_
   case, you don't have to wrap the form by the parentheses any more, if you want.

* v0.6.8
** Bug fixed and code cleaned up

* v0.6.6
** `pass:[some->]` and `pass:[some->>]` support in `dbg` and `clog` added for the
   debugging convenience.

   19] for the details.

* v0.6.5
** The redundant printing bug related to `dbg` inside `dbgn` fixed.
** Documented: a trick on debugging multiple forms with `dbgn`.

* v0.6.4
** Bug fixed: issue #16
** Bumps `clojure-future-spec 1.9.0` and `cljs-devtools 1.0.0`

* v0.6.3
** The printed format of evaluating the multiple forms in `dbg`/`clog` is changed for
   readability.

** The namespace and line number of the source code are relocated to the top line for
   readability.

* v0.6.0
** Changed: _number_ option of *debux* macros is now applied to not only `seq` data type
   but also all the `coll` data types. (Previously, the _number_ option was applied to
   only `seq` data type.)
*** This change will prevent the elements of the deeply nested massive `coll` data types
    from being printed too much.
** Renamed: `set-print-seq-length!` pass:q[-->] `set-print-length!`
